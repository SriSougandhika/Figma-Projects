# Snackcident – Cooking for the Culinary Clueless

## 🧠 Problem Statement:
People who live alone, are new to cooking, or are just plain lazy often feel overwhelmed by traditional cooking apps. Recipes assume you have 10 spices and a food processor — but what if you only have bread, eggs, and existential dread?
Snackcident is a fun, minimal-effort cooking assistant that takes basic ingredients and helps users make something quick, tasty, and goof-proof — while adding humor and confidence.

## 🌟 Target Users:
- College students
